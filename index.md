This is where content goes, clearly. I wonder how linking pages together's going to work.

Remember when you had your first website? Sonja was like, "But who would care about you enough to look at a website you made?" That kind of sucked. Maybe I would have had a better website. But probably not, who am I kidding, making websites is difficult when you don't have much to say.
